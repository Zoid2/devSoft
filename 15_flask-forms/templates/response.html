     If no one does, seek external assistance.
     
     PROTIP: Revisit code from foundations if you have it.
     Peruse this code together and discuss how it should work,

    You used a {{method}} method
    </h3>
    <p>
      There are two html methods - get and post. If you used GET, you'll notice that your information is visible in the browser URL, as the GET method changes the url and flask processes that. If you used POST, data was sent directly instead of modifying the url.
